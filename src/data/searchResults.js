    description: 'No matter how much experience you have with JavaScript, odds are you don’t fully understand the language. As part of the \"You Don’t Know JS\" series, this compact guide focuses on new features available in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), the latest version of the standard upon which JavaScript is built. Like other books in this series, You Don’t Know JS: ES6 & Beyond dives into trickier parts of the language that many JavaScript programmers either avoid or know nothing about. Armed with this knowledge, you can achieve true JavaScript mastery. With this book, you will: Learn new ES6 syntax that eases the pain points of common programming idioms Organize code with iterators, generators, modules, and classes Express async flow control with Promises combined with generators Use collections to work more efficiently with data in structured ways Leverage new API helpers, including Array, Object, Math, Number, and String Extend your program’s capabilities through meta programming Preview features likely coming to JS beyond ES6',
